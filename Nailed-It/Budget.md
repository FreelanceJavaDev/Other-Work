#Nailed it! Budget edition
Sometimes budgets don't go so well.  Especially when some numbers are put down as a multiple of some number that's pulled out of thin air.
I had lightning strike in the same budget twice.  First was when I was ordering T-shirts from a club that we ordered some the previous year.
I didn't have the records in front of me so I guessed $10 a shirt, knowing we didn't need many more I made that purchase our buffer 
budget of a nice round numeber of 25 shirts, with $150 as a budget.  When I was organizing the records I found the invoices. 
The shirts were $10 exactly.  I also found the invoice for our halloween party for that year. The catering bill was the 
amount I had placed in the budget for the catering which was the same as previous years and the buffer I put just in case something 
or several somethings came up.
The art of inserting the budget buffer in plain sight by using convincing numbers is an art form I never knew I had. 
And one that I'll probably wouldn't have discovered without that club.
