#Why Freelance Java Dev
The story of this name began when I was a senior in high school.  I used FJD as my username on the now defucnt indie game site Desra back when all I knew was Java.  As I continued I used the abbrivation FJD as a code documentation handle, it was short for Freelance Java Developer.

Then I moved to the east coast and at the house I was in I found a brick stamped with the mark "FJD". I didn't see that one coming myself.  It wasn't the only wierd thing that was personal at that house, or the first one. An anchor with a boey marked with my mother's initals was in a side yard. After that brick, I concluded that the name had to stay, and since by some divine luck, FreelanceJavaDev was actually available as a username I grabbed it.

While Java isn't my primary programming language anymore, it was my first programming language and firsts are always memorable.

As a compromise to display my new wider programming language exposure and not sacrifice the name I made my GitHub profile picture my way of advertising my skills.  The C represents C, the Arduino (that I flipped the + and -) represents my hardware skills,  The + is combined with the C to make C++, the - is for electrical ground.  And finally the Coffee cup filled with coffee represents Java, the steam signifies the origin of my username as FJD and finallly the Curly braces signifying the syntax.  I made the icon myself, and I've made some others for myself as well.
