# Punch Cards

Ah, Fall Semester Finals... The hall council in my dorm I was part of organized a party before finals.  I suggested the name Final Blast as a joke.  Unfortunately we had to make this "Study related" type of event.  And that's part of the reason for the punch cards.  It's study tips and that was our "Study related" segment.  

The front design was actually something I had intended to make for a class the previous semester.  That was making a Koch Snowflake using a recursive algorithm.  It didn't go as planned, turning into a strange Rorschach test.  Sometimes it looked like a Doritos chip, other times it looked like Zant's Helmet from **Twilight Princess**. So I decided to take what I considered a failure and turn it into a success.  Hence the snowflake design.  The Koch Snowflake is a fractal design using triangles so it was quick to make.

The back I picked a what I thought was a whimsical font with a winter feel to go with the theme.  I then made the light bulb in about two minutes, then made the back appear symmetric.
