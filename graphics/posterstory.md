# The Accidental Club Logo

Sometimes artwork without the artist even having to say anything can become a Logo, even if it wasn't intended to.  
This poster is 36x48, designed soley for one event.  It was part cultural education, history, game refrences and cultural icons. 
All designed with one single overarching and seamless message that came to it's zenith in the visual here.  Now I was just expecting a poster.
Then I got the pleasant surprise of it going on a T-shirt that members wore.  Finally when we made a Japanese Garden out of plywood and in
a choice for paint the vote was for White and Red.  I had a feeling what was going to happen, but I was construction and planning 
I stayed away from the design.  And the design that was chosen for the top of the lantern was a very similar design to the background.  
And that's when I knew I'd somehow made the logo for the club entirely by accident and I said nothing to make that happen.  
Though something about the rising sun with rays surrounding a solar powered garden lantern solar panel does seem fitting.

I really don't know exactly how the whole thing happened, but apparently the Office of student life knew it before I did.
